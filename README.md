## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The email field is validated using native HTML5 validation.

- Error messages are displayed using the validationMessage property.

- Form data is collected using the FormData interface.

- Data validation and saving are performed in JavaScript.

- Uses CSS pseudo-classes like :invalid and :valid to provide visual feedback to the user.

### Continued development

- Data Storage: Send form data to a backend server using RESTful APIs for database storage.

- User Authentication: Implement user login and registration to personalize the experience and store emails securely.
